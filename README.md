# CO2 Emission Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting future CO2 emissions for individual countries using machine learning techniques. It aims to provide policymakers with valuable insights to craft effective strategies for mitigating climate change.

## Project Description

Climate change, driven by rising CO2 emissions, is a critical global challenge. 
This project addresses this issue by developing a machine learning model to predict future CO2 emissions at the national level.Unlike existing systems that often focus on global trends, 
this project emphasizes national-level data and incorporates various influencing factors to provide granular and actionable insights. 
The project involves:

* **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Gathering and cleaning historical CO2 emission data and data on influencing factors (e.g., energy consumption, industrial activity). 
* **Machine Learning Model Training:** Training a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Regression or LSTM networks) to predict CO2 emissions. 
* **Model Evaluation and Refinement:** Evaluating the model's accuracy and improving it through techniques like cross-validation. 
* **Scenario Analysis and Policy Insights:** Using the model to forecast emissions under different policy scenarios.
* **Causal Relationship Analysis (Optional):** Identifying causal relationships between influencing factors and CO2 emissions.
